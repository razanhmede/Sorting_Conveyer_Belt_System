# Sorting_Conveyer_Belt_System

## Overview

BOB: Balanced Organizing Bot is a conveyer belt-based system that deals with sorting different 
materials that are placed by the gripper at the beginning of the belt. There is constant communication 
between the gripper system and the conveyer belt for optimal coordination.
The idea behind this project arises from the urgent need for resource efficiency by sorting materials based 
on their properties. Therefore, different techniques specific for each property are used for detection.
This project is a demonstration for an environmental sustainability design that can be used on a wider scale 
to minimize pollution and facilitate recycling.
We aim in this project to demonstrate the working of mechanical based design such as the conveyer belt, 
gears, pulleys and gripper with software-based applications such as vs-code for computer vision and 
Arduino IDE for coding.

## Description

Conveyer belt sorting system- Detecting plastic, wood, metal –Giving the user output as form of 
ramp movement based on the result of detection – gripper to automate the placement of the objects on the 
conveyer belt

## Purpose

Sorting-based projects, can be used for recycling and manufacturing purposes
